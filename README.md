## Baking Calculator

Baking Calculator is an Android app to precify recipes, built in Jetpack Compose, using Clean Architecture, coroutines, Flow, and single activity.

### Getting started

1. Download and install the Android app from the Google Play Store.
2. Open the app and register the supplies
3. Create a new recipe.
4. Enter the name, quantity, and price of each item in the recipe.
6. Tap the "Precify" button to calculate the total price of the recipe.

### Clean Architecture

Precificando is built using Clean Architecture, which is a software design pattern that separates the app into different layers. This makes the app more modular and easier to maintain.

* The **presentation layer** is responsible for displaying the user interface and handling user interactions.
* The **domain layer** contains the business logic of the app, such as the logic for precifying recipes.
* The **data layer** is responsible for interacting with the data, such as saving and loading recipes.

### Coroutines and Flow

Precificando uses coroutines and Flow to manage asynchronous tasks. Coroutines are lightweight threads that can be used to run multiple tasks simultaneously. Flow is a library for managing asynchronous streams of data.

### Single activity

Precificando uses a single-activity architecture. This means that the app has a single activity that handles all of the different screens in the app. This makes the app more efficient and easier to navigate.


OBS: This app is disabled in the Play Store. In the future, I will revive it and fix the key privacy
